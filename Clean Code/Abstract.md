# Abstract
We are writing code to be easily maintained. This means that our readers can easily read what we're doing, whether that's us when we come back, even years later, or someone with no familiarity with the code base. Writing clean code will allow us to more easily write code because more time is spend reading that writing code, by far. So if we can make our code easier to understand, read, update and maintain, we will be better programmers. This will allow us to write code more quickly ourselves as well, the quick way to write code may be the long way to read it, which will mean it takes a much longer time to continue to add to the code base. So the quickest way to write code, is to write clean code.

## [[Programming/Clean Code/Nomenclature#TPM | Total Productive Maintenance]]
TPM focuses on maintenance rather than production, there is a focus on five pillars called the 5S principle. This principle is derived from the Japanese automotive production industry. 

### Seiri
Sorting, using familiar names so that you know where things are and what they do.

### Seiton
Tidiness, everything has its place and you know where to find it. If not, refactor it to get it there.

### Seiso
Shine, keep everything clean. Eliminate commented out code, what the authors say about littering your code with comments?

### Seiketsu
Standardization, consistent coding style with you and your workspace.

### Shutsuke
Self-discipline, follow best practices, reflect on your code consistently and be willing to change.

## Leblanc's Law
Later equals never, keep your code clean.
